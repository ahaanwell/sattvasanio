  <div className="space-y-6">

    <p>
      <strong>Sattva Sanio</strong> has a range of modern, large flats that are made to fit the wants of different
      buyers. There are <b>2 BHK, 3 BHK, and 4 BHK homes</b> in the building. Each one was carefully

      things like the size of the flat, its floor level, its location in the tower, and the way it faces. The
      project offers a range of unit sizes so that buyers can find homes that meet their needs for
      room and fit their lifestyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>2 BHK homes</b> are great for workers and small families, while the <b>3 BHK flats</b> have more
      room for families to live comfortably. The <b>4 BHK apartments</b> are the largest in the building and
